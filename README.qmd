## Description

Welcome to the **Medical Statistics** course repository.
This repo contains all teaching materials, exercises, datasets, and project resources used in the course.

The course focuses on **clinical data analysis, biostatistics, and data-driven clinical decision-making** through hands-on learning and real-world case studies. For the academic regulations of the course, see [Medical Statistics](https://moduler.aau.dk/course/2024-2025/MEDMS24B5_1).

### Course Overview

The purpose of this module is to provide students with fundamental skills in:

- Handling and managing clinical and health-related data
- Visualizing and exploring biomedical datasets
- Applying biostatistical methods to clinical and industrial medical problems
- Supporting clinical decision-making using quantitative evidence

Teaching begins with practical, case-based exercises and progresses toward independent statistical projects with collaborative workshops and evaluations.

### Learning Objectives

#### **Knowledge**
Students will:

- Understand uncertainty, probability, and core biostatistical concepts
- Recognize major study designs and distinguish between **explanatory**, **exploratory**, and **predictive** studies
- Explain random and non-random variation
- Understand the limitations and possibilities of statistical tools
- Apply biostatistics to problems in medicine with industrial specialization

#### **Skills**
Students will be able to:

- Read and interpret software documentation
- Select and apply appropriate visualization tools for health data
- Formulate scientific statistical problems and apply biostatistical methods
- Manipulate, visualize, and analyze complex and large datasets
- Communicate statistical results in a clinical context using relevant literature and databases
- Collaborate effectively in interdisciplinary project groups

#### **Competencies**
Students will:

- Quantify clinical and health-related problems using biostatistical methods
- Integrate uncertainty and clinical relevance in decision-making
- Translate data analysis into clinical decision support
- Critically evaluate statistical approaches and participate in scientific discussions

### Teaching Format

- Interactive lectures
- Individual problem-based assignments
- Group-based project work
- Joint project workshops and evaluations

This repository contains all materials for the course Medical Statistics at Aalborg University, Faculty of Health as a collaboration between the Department of Health Science & Technology and the Department of Clinical Medicine. The course is currently offered for the education Medicine with Industrial Specialization at the 5th semester. For more detail on the course, check out the [welcome
page]({{< meta urls.home >}}).

## Lesson content

The teaching material is found mainly in these locations:

-   `index.Rmd`: Contains the overview of the workshop.
-   `overview/` folder: Contains the files that give an overview to the
    course, such as the syllabus and schedule.
-   `pre-workshop/`: Contains the files needed before the workshop, like
    the pre-workshop tasks.
-   `sessions/`: Contains the files used during the workshop (e.g.
    code-along material).
-   `appendix/`: Contains the files used to support the workshop, such
    as code of conduct, changelog, contributing guides, and instructions
    for teachers.
-   `slides/`: Contains the lecture slides that are rendered into HTML
    slides from Markdown.

The website is generated with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), so it
follows the file and folder structure conventions from that package.

## Support and infrastructure files

-   `.copier-answers.yml`: Contains the answers you gave when copying
    the project from the template. **You should not modify this file
    directly.**
-   `.cz.toml`:
    [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/)
    configuration file for managing versions and changelogs.
-   `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
    configuration file for managing and running checks before each
    commit.
-   `.typos.toml`: [typos](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos) spell
    checker configuration file.
-   `.zenodo.json`: Structured citation metadata for your project when
    archived on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). This is used to add the
    metadata to Zenodo when a GitHub release has been uploaded to
    Zenodo.
-   `justfile`: [`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/) configuration
    file for scripting project tasks.
-   `.editorconfig`: Editor configuration file for
    [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to maintain consistent
    coding styles across different editors and IDEs.
-   `CHANGELOG.md`: Changelog file for tracking changes in the project.
-   `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the project.
-   `.github/`: Contains GitHub-specific files, such as issue and pull
    request templates, workflows,
    [dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide)
    configuration, pull request templates, and a
    [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)
    file.
