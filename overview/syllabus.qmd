# Syllabus {#sec-syllabus}

Learn to turn clinical data into robust evidence that informs real clinical and research decisions. Healthcare generates enormous amounts of data, yet many decisions are still based on studies with limited statistical rigor, misinterpreted results, or insufficient consideration of uncertainty, bias, and reproducibility. Clinicians and researchers increasingly need the skills to critically appraise the literature and understand how evidence is generated, interpreted, and communicated in scientific work. To address this, you need strong statistical reasoning, practical data analysis skills, and the ability to translate quantitative results into clinically meaningful insight. In this course, you will learn how to use R for data analysis; understand probability, uncertainty, and stochastic processes; apply regression and generalized linear models; design and validate prediction models; evaluate bias, confounding, and reproducibility; perform power and sample size calculations; analyze time-to-event and repeated-measures data; and connect statistical findings to clinical decision-making and meta-analysis.

By the end of the course, you will be able to engage confidently with scientific research, communicate quantitative findings clearly, and contribute to high-quality evidence generation. These skills will empower you to participate fully in modern clinical and translational research, collaborate effectively with statisticians and data scientists, and strengthen the scientific basis of your clinical and research practice.
